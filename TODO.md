# TODO

On the vision branch, I want to create the code to give vision or eyes to the WaifuAI so she can see the world and people around her and respond having those images as context.

## Tasks

1. Make functions or methods to take pictures inside VRChat, using the ingame camera.
1. Make funtions or methods using watchdog to detect when a new image is created inside the `img` folder and return a tuple containing the paths to the images.
1. Make functions or methods to read the images, prepare and save them to be used as context.
1. Integrate the functions or methods to the main code.
