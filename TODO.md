# TODO

On the vision branch, I want to create the code to give vision or eyes to the WaifuAI so she can see the world and people around her and respond having those images as context.

## Tasks

1. Make functions or methods to take pictures inside VRChat, using the ingame camera.
1. Make funtions or methods using watchdog to detect when a new image is created inside the `img` folder.
1. Make functions or methods to read the images, prepare and save them to be used as context.
1. Integrate the functions or methods to the main code.

Turns out that I need to migrate to `openai v1` to use the `image` parameter, so I will need to wait until I migrate to `v1` to continue with this task.

Just finished the migration of OpenAI API to `v1`, now I can continue with the task.

But I been working for 13 hours straight, so I will continue tomorrow.
